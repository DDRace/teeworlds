Dear Mac OSX User...

to get this mod compiled with MySQL on a Mac running OSX 10.5 or newer you need to download and unzip three little things first.

1. Download:
   * the appropiate Version (e.g. 32 vs. 64 bit) of the MySQL Community Server at
     http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
   * the appropiate Version (e.g. 32 vs. 64 bit) of the MySQL Connector/C++ at
     http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/
   * boost at (the connector needs it)
     http://www.boost.org/

2. Unzip:
   * the MySQL Community Server files and move them to
     /usr/local/mysql/
   * Unzip the MySQL Connector/C++ files and move them to
     /usr/local/mysql/
   * Unzip the boost files and move the boost folder >inside of< boost to (it will be a collection of header files) to
     /usr/local/mysql/includes

Of course you could extract only the needed lib and header files and put them somewhere else (e.g. in your teeworlds folder) but above solution is intended to be easy and quick to apply.

Thanks for reading
